# Bash Scripts

This repository just holds some of my bash scripts for a bit of automation.
These are currently just some installers that I made to make my life easier.

Currently there are installers for:

* Docker
* Gitlab
* Gitlab Runner
* Java
* MySQL
* phpMyAdmin

And some general things like `htop` or `ufw`.

# Repository

This is something I can use very fast and not for others to collaborate on. Therefore this will not follow a git flow and also the commit messages can be just crap.

# Usage

## Installers

Upload all files from the `installers` folder to the server.

```sh
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```
